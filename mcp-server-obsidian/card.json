Most descriptions adequately explain functionality and usage context, with some providing good detail (like obsidian_complex_search). Parameter descriptions are generally clear with appropriate constraints and defaults specified. However, some descriptions are quite brief (obsidian_append_content, obsidian_delete_file) and could benefit from more context about when to use them or important limitations. The toolset is consistently good but lacks the comprehensive detail needed for an A grade.","score":"B"},
