Parameter descriptions are generally clear and include helpful details like constraints and optional indicators. However, the tool descriptions are quite brief (mostly single sentences) and lack important context about usage scenarios, limitations, or what information is returned. While functional, the documentation leaves users with questions about when to use each tool and what to expect from them.","score":"C"},
