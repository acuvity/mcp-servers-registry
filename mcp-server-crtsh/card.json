The description is adequate but brief, explaining what it does (discovers subdomains) and the data source (SSL certificate logs). The parameter documentation is basic but clear, with a good example. However, the description lacks important details about usage context, limitations, and what specific information is returned, which would elevate it to a higher grade.","score":"C"},
