# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure awslabs.cloudwatch-logs-mcp-server run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need.

| Guardrail                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `covert-instruction-detection`   | Detects hidden or obfuscated directives in requests.                    |
| `sensitive-pattern-detection`    | Flags patterns suggesting sensitive data or filesystem exposure.        |
| `shadowing-pattern-detection`    | Identifies tool descriptions that override or influence others.         |
| `schema-misuse-prevention`       | Enforces strict schema compliance on input data.                        |
| `cross-origin-tool-access`       | Controls calls to external services or APIs.                            |
| `secrets-redaction`              | Prevents exposure of credentials or sensitive values.                   |

Example: add `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction sensitive-pattern-detection"` to enable those guardrails.

## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, define `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with a shared secret.

Example: add `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"` to enable the basic authentication.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
```

Specifies compute resource guarantees and caps:
- **requests**: minimum CPU/memory Kubernetes will reserve.
- **limits** (commented out by default): maximum CPU/memory the container may use.

## Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health

```

Configures additional volumes and persistent storage:
- **volumes**: arbitrary Kubernetes `volume` entries to attach.
- **volumeMounts**: mount points inside containers.
- **storage**: iterates `package.storage` entries:
  - for persistent entries, creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs` with `storageClassName: <class>` and `resources.requests.storage: <size>`.

## Placement and Scheduling

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
```

Controls Pod scheduling to nodes:

        path:
      # Do not validate Policer CA. Do not do this in production
      # insecure: true
```

To enable guardrails you can set `minibridge.guardrails` list as:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs --version 1.0.0 --set 'minibridge.guardrails={secrets-redaction}'
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  guardrails:
  - covert-instruction-detection
  - sensitive-pattern-detection
  - shadowing-pattern-detection
  - schema-misuse-prevention
  - cross-origin-tool-access
  - secrets-redaction
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

To enable basic auth:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs --version 1.0.0 --set minibridge.basicAuth.value="supersecret"
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  basicAuth:
    value: "supersecret"
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-cloudwatch-logs --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

<summary>describe_log_groups</summary>

**Description**:

```
Lists AWS CloudWatch log groups and saved queries associated with them, optionally filtering by a name prefix.

    This tool retrieves information about log groups in the account, or log groups in accounts linked to this account as a monitoring account.
    If a prefix is provided, only log groups with names starting with the specified prefix are returned.

    Additionally returns any user saved queries that are associated with any of the returned log groups.

    Usage: Use this tool to discover log groups that you'd retrieve or query logs from and queries that have been saved by the user.

    Returns:
    --------
    List of log group metadata dictionaries and saved queries associated with them
       Each log group metadata contains details such as:
            - logGroupName: The name of the log group.
            - creationTime: Timestamp when the log group was created
            - retentionInDays: Retention period, if set
            - storedBytes: The number of bytes stored.
            - kmsKeyId: KMS Key Id used for data encryption, if set
            - dataProtectionStatus: Displays whether this log group has a protection policy, or whether it had one in the past, if set
            - logGroupClass: Type of log group class
            - logGroupArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group. This version of the ARN doesn't include a trailing :* after the log group name.
        Any saved queries that are applicable to the returned log groups are also included.
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |

<summary>analyze_log_group</summary>

**Description**:

```
Analyzes a CloudWatch log group for anomalies, message patterns, and error patterns within a specified time window.

    This tool performs an analysis of the specified log group by:
    1. Discovering and checking log anomaly detectors associated with the log group
    2. Retrieving anomalies from those detectors that fall within the specified time range
    3. Identifying the top 5 most common message patterns
    4. Finding the top 5 patterns containing error-related terms

    Usage: Use this tool to detect anomalies and understand common patterns in your log data, particularly
    focusing on error patterns that might indicate issues. This can help identify potential problems and
    understand the typical behavior of your application.

    Returns:
    --------
    A LogAnalysisResult object containing:
        - log_anomaly_results: Information about anomaly detectors and their findings
            * anomaly_detectors: List of anomaly detectors for the log group
            * anomalies: List of anomalies that fall within the specified time range
        - top_patterns: Results of the query for most common message patterns
        - top_patterns_containing_errors: Results of the query for patterns containing error-related terms
            (error, exception, fail, timeout, fatal)
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| end_time | string | ISO 8601 formatted end time for the CloudWatch Logs Insights query window (e.g., "2025-04-19T21:00:00+00:00"). | Yes
| log_group_arn | string | The log group arn to look for anomalies in, as returned by the describe_log_groups tools | Yes
| start_time | string | ISO 8601 formatted start time for the CloudWatch Logs Insights query window (e.g., "2025-04-19T20:00:00+00:00"). | Yes

<summary>execute_log_insights_query</summary>

**Description**:

```
Executes a CloudWatch Logs Insights query and waits for the results to be available.

    IMPORTANT: The operation must include exactly one of the following parameters: log_group_names, or log_group_identifiers.

    CRITICAL: The volume of returned logs can easily overwhelm the agent context window. Always include a limit in the query
    (| limit 50) or using the limit parameter.

    Usage: Use to query, filter, collect statistics, or find patterns in one or more log groups. For example, the following
    query lists exceptions per hour.

    ```
    filter @message like /Exception/
    | stats count(*) as exceptionCount by bin(1h)
    | sort exceptionCount desc
    ```

    Returns:
    --------
        A dictionary containing the final query results, including:
            - status: The current status of the query (e.g., Scheduled, Running, Complete, Failed, etc.)
            - results: A list of the actual query results if the status is Complete.
            - statistics: Query performance statistics
            - messages: Any informational messages about the query
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| end_time | string | ISO 8601 formatted end time for the CloudWatch Logs Insights query window (e.g., "2025-04-19T21:00:00+00:00"). | Yes
| limit | any | The maximum number of log events to return. It is critical to use either this parameter or a `| limit <int>` operator in the query to avoid consuming too many tokens of the agent. | No
| log_group_identifiers | any | The list of up to 50 logGroupIdentifiers to query. You can specify them by the log group name or ARN. If a log group that you're querying is in a source account and you're using a monitoring account, you must use the ARN. CRITICAL: Exactly one of [log_group_names, log_group_identifiers] should be non-null. | No
| log_group_names | any | The list of up to 50 log group names to be queried. CRITICAL: Exactly one of [log_group_names, log_group_identifiers] should be non-null. | No
| max_timeout | integer | Maximum time in second to poll for complete results before giving up | No
| query_string | string | The query string in the Cloudwatch Log Insights Query Language. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html. | Yes
| start_time | string | ISO 8601 formatted start time for the CloudWatch Logs Insights query window (e.g., "2025-04-19T20:00:00+00:00"). | Yes

<summary>get_query_results</summary>

**Description**:

```
Retrieves the results of a previously started CloudWatch Logs Insights query.

    Usage: If a log query is started by execute_log_insights_query tool and has a polling time out, this tool can be used to try to retrieve
    the query results again.

    Returns:
    --------
        A dictionary containing the final query results, including:
            - status: The current status of the query (e.g., Scheduled, Running, Complete, Failed, etc.)
            - results: A list of the actual query results if the status is Complete.
            - statistics: Query performance statistics
            - messages: Any informational messages about the query
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
