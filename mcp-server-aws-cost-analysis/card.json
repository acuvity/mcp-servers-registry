Most descriptions adequately explain functionality with 2-3 sentences covering what the tool does and when to use it. The get_pricing_from_api and generate_cost_report tools have comprehensive descriptions with detailed usage guidance and examples. However, several parameters lack descriptions (project_path, service_code, region) or have minimal descriptions, and some tools like get_bedrock_patterns have very brief descriptions that could be more informative about their specific functionality.","score":"B"},
