Most descriptions adequately explain functionality in 1-2 sentences with good context about what each tool does. Parameter descriptions are generally clear and complete, explaining purpose, types, and expected values effectively. Some tools like 'get_all_repositories_tree' and search functions have particularly thorough documentation. Minor gaps exist in a few areas where descriptions could be slightly more comprehensive, but overall the documentation provides sufficient guidance for proper tool usage.","score":"B"},
