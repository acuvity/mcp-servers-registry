Most tools have meaningful descriptions that explain their purpose, though some lack important context like usage scenarios or limitations. Parameter documentation is generally clear with proper types and constraints. Some complex tools like pull request review management could benefit from more detailed workflow guidance, and a few descriptions are quite brief. The toolset demonstrates consistent structure and organization across GitHub API operations.","score":"B"},
