Most descriptions adequately explain what each tool does and when to use it, with some excellent examples like 'list_notifications' providing comprehensive context. Parameter descriptions are generally clear with good use of enums and constraints. However, some tools have minimal descriptions (e.g., 'get_tag', 'list_branches') and a few complex tools could benefit from more detailed usage guidance.","score":"B"},
