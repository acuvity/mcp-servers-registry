However, the documentation is significantly undermined by multiple typos in parameter names ('acces_keys', 'secret_acces_key') and several parameters lack sufficient detail about expected formats, valid values, or usage context. The 'full_report' parameter completely lacks a description, which is a notable gap.","score":"C"},
