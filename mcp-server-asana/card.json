Most descriptions adequately explain functionality in 1-2 sentences. Parameter descriptions are generally clear with good detail for complex parameters like custom_fields and search filters. However, some descriptions are quite brief (e.g., 'Get detailed information about a specific task') and could benefit from more context about when to use each tool and what specific information they provide versus what they don't.","score":"B"},
