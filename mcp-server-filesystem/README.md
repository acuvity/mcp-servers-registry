**Description:** MCP server for filesystem access

> [!NOTE]
> `mcp-server-filesystem` has been packaged by Acuvity from @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem original [sources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a built-in Rego policy that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Gardrails

### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

## Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

> [!NOTE]
> All guardrails start disabled. You can switch each one on or off individually, so you only activate the protections your environment requires.


# üì¶ How to Use


> [!NOTE]
> Given mcp-server-filesystem scope of operation the intended usage is to run natively on the targeted machine to access local resources.

# üß∞ Clients Integrations

Below are the steps for configuring most clients that use MCP to elevate their Copilot experience.

> [!NOTE]
> These integrations function natively across all Minibridge modes.

</details>

## üê≥ Run it with Docker
**Required volumes or mountPaths:**
  - data to be mounted on `/data`


<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only -v path:/data docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-filesystem:2025.3.28`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -i --rm --read-only -v path:/data docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-filesystem:2025.3.28
```

Add `-p <localport>:8000` to expose the port.

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use something like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-filesystem": {
      "url": "http://localhost:<localport>/sse",
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familiar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-filesystem": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Minibridge offers a host of additional features. For step-by-step guidance, please visit the wiki. And if anything‚Äôs unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!

## üõ°Ô∏è Runtime security

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need. Available options:
- covert-instruction-detection
- sensitive-pattern-detection
- shadowing-pattern-detection
- schema-misuse-prevention
- cross-origin-tool-access
- secrets-redaction

for example, `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction covert-instruction-detection"` will enable the `secrets-redaction` and `covert-instruction-detection` guardrails.


To turn on Basic Authentication, set BASIC_AUTH_SECRET like `- e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret`

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization: Bearer supersecret` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### How to install

You can inspect the chart `README`:

```console
helm show readme oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-filesystem --version 1.0.0
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-filesystem --version 1.0.0
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-filesystem oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-filesystem --version 1.0.0
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-filesystem will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-filesystem` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will create a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.

See full charts [Readme](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-filesystem/charts/mcp-server-filesystem/README.md) for more details about settings and runtime security including guardrails activation.
