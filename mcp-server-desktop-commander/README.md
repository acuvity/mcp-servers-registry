# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need.

| Guardrail                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `covert-instruction-detection`   | Detects hidden or obfuscated directives in requests.                    |
| `sensitive-pattern-detection`    | Flags patterns suggesting sensitive data or filesystem exposure.        |
| `shadowing-pattern-detection`    | Identifies tool descriptions that override or influence others.         |
| `schema-misuse-prevention`       | Enforces strict schema compliance on input data.                        |
| `cross-origin-tool-access`       | Controls calls to external services or APIs.                            |
| `secrets-redaction`              | Prevents exposure of credentials or sensitive values.                   |

Example: add `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction sensitive-pattern-detection"` to enable those guardrails.

## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, define `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with a shared secret.

Example: add `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"` to enable the basic authentication.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.


# üì¶ How to Install


> [!TIP]
> Given mcp-server-desktop-commander scope of operation the intended usage is to run natively on the targeted machine to access local resources.

**Environment variables and secrets:**
  - `HOME` optional (/tmp)

For more information and extra configuration you can consult the [package](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP) documentation.

# üß∞ Clients Integrations

Below are the steps for configuring most clients that use MCP to elevate their Copilot experience.

```

See [OpenAI Agents SDK docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) for more info.

</details>

## üê≥ Run it with Docker

<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw,nosuid,nodev docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander:0.2.3`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:rw,nosuid,nodev docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander:0.2.3
```

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use it like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-desktop-commander": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familiar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-desktop-commander": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Minibridge offers a host of additional features. For step-by-step guidance, please visit the wiki. And if anything‚Äôs unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### Chart settings requirements

This chart requires some mandatory information to be installed.

**Optional Environment variables**:
  - `HOME="/tmp"` environment variable can be changed with env.HOME="/tmp"

### How to install

You can inspect the chart `README`:

```console
helm show readme oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-desktop-commander will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-desktop-commander` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will create a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.

See full charts [Readme](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/charts/mcp-server-desktop-commander/README.md) for more details about settings and runtime security including guardrails activation.

<summary>read_file</summary>

**Description**:

```

                        Read the contents of a file from the file system or a URL with optional offset and length parameters.
                        
                        Prefer this over 'execute_command' with cat/type for viewing files.
                        
                        Supports partial file reading with:
                        - 'offset' (start line, default: 0)
                          * Positive: Start from line N (0-based indexing)
                          * Negative: Read last N lines from end (tail behavior)
                        - 'length' (max lines to read, default: configurable via 'fileReadLineLimit' setting, initially 1000)
                          * Used with positive offsets for range reading
                          * Ignored when offset is negative (reads all requested tail lines)
                        
                        Examples:
                        - offset: 0, length: 10     ‚Üí First 10 lines
                        - offset: 100, length: 5    ‚Üí Lines 100-104
                        - offset: -20               ‚Üí Last 20 lines

                        - Large files with negative offsets use reverse reading for efficiency
                        - Large files with deep positive offsets use byte estimation

<summary>write_file</summary>

**Description**:

```

                        Write or append to file contents. 

                        üéØ CHUNKING IS STANDARD PRACTICE: Always write files in chunks of 25-30 lines maximum.
                        This is the normal, recommended way to write files - not an emergency measure.

                        STANDARD PROCESS FOR ANY FILE:
                        1. FIRST ‚Üí write_file(filePath, firstChunk, {mode: 'rewrite'})  [‚â§30 lines]
                        2. THEN ‚Üí write_file(filePath, secondChunk, {mode: 'append'})   [‚â§30 lines]
                        3. CONTINUE ‚Üí write_file(filePath, nextChunk, {mode: 'append'}) [‚â§30 lines]

                        ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS CHUNK PROACTIVELY - don't wait for performance warnings!

                        WHEN TO CHUNK (always be proactive):
                        1. Any file expected to be longer than 25-30 lines
                        2. When writing multiple files in sequence
                        3. When creating documentation, code files, or configuration files
                        
                        HANDLING CONTINUATION ("Continue" prompts):
                        If user asks to "Continue" after an incomplete operation:
                        1. Read the file to see what was successfully written
                        2. Continue writing ONLY the remaining content using {mode: 'append'}
                        3. Keep chunks to 25-30 lines each
                        
                        Files over 50 lines will generate performance notes but are still written successfully.
                        Only works within allowed directories.
                        
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

<summary>edit_block</summary>

**Description**:

```

                        Apply surgical text replacements to files.
                        
                        BEST PRACTICE: Make multiple small, focused edits rather than one large edit.
                        Each edit_block call should change only what needs to be changed - include just enough 
                        context to uniquely identify the text being modified.
                        
                        Takes:
                        - file_path: Path to the file to edit
                        - old_string: Text to replace
                        - new_string: Replacement text
                        - expected_replacements: Optional parameter for number of replacements
                        
                        By default, replaces only ONE occurrence of the search text.
                        To replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with
                        the exact number of matches expected.
                        
                        UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT: When expected_replacements=1 (default), include the minimal
                        amount of context necessary (typically 1-3 lines) before and after the change point,
                        with exact whitespace and indentation.
                        
                        When editing multiple sections, make separate edit_block calls for each distinct change
                        rather than one large replacement.
                        
                        When a close but non-exact match is found, a character-level diff is shown in the format:
                        common_prefix{-removed-}{+added+}common_suffix to help you identify what's different.
                        
                        Similar to write_file, there is a configurable line limit (fileWriteLineLimit) that warns
                        if the edited file exceeds this limit. If this happens, consider breaking your edits into
                        smaller, more focused changes.
                        
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

                        NOTE: For file operations, prefer specialized tools like read_file, search_code, 
                        list_directory instead of cat, grep, or ls commands.
