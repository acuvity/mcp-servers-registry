Tool names are clear and descriptive, indicating their purpose well. Descriptions are comprehensive (2-4 sentences) covering functionality, usage context, and important limitations. Most parameters have adequate descriptions with types and constraints specified. However, some parameter descriptions could be more detailed (e.g., 'shell' parameter lacks explanation of valid values), and a few tools have overly verbose descriptions that could be more concise. The consistent inclusion of usage notes and security warnings shows good attention to detail.","score":"B"},
