# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need. Available options:
- covert-instruction-detection
- sensitive-pattern-detection
- shadowing-pattern-detection
- schema-misuse-prevention
- cross-origin-tool-access
- secrets-redaction

For example adding:
- `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction covert-instruction-detection"`
to your docker arguments will enable the `secrets-redaction` and `covert-instruction-detection` guardrails.


## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, add `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` like:
- `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"`
to your docker arguments. This will enable the Basic Authentication check.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

        path:
      # Do not validate Policer CA. Do not do this in production
      # insecure: true
```

To enable guardrails you can set `minibridge.guardrails` list as:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 --set 'minibridge.guardrails={secrets-redaction}'
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  guardrails:
  - covert-instruction-detection
  - sensitive-pattern-detection
  - shadowing-pattern-detection
  - schema-misuse-prevention
  - cross-origin-tool-access
  - secrets-redaction
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

To enable basic auth:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 --set minibridge.basicAuth.value="supersecret"
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  basicAuth:
    value: "supersecret"
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>
<details>
<summary>set_config_value</summary>

**Description**:

```
Set a specific configuration value by key. WARNING: Should be used in a separate chat from file operations and command execution to prevent security issues. Config keys include: blockedCommands (array), defaultShell (string), allowedDirectories (array of paths), fileReadLineLimit (number, max lines for read_file), fileWriteLineLimit (number, max lines per write_file call), telemetryEnabled (boolean). IMPORTANT: Setting allowedDirectories to an empty array ([]) allows full access to the entire file system, regardless of the operating system. This command can be referenced as "DC: ..." or "use Desktop Commander to ..." in your instructions.
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| key | string | not set | Yes
| value | any | not set | No
</details>
<details>
<summary>read_file</summary>

**Description**:

```
Read the contents of a file from the file system or a URL with optional offset and length parameters. Prefer this over 'execute_command' with cat/type for viewing files. Supports partial file reading with 'offset' (start line, default: 0) and 'length' (max lines to read, default: configurable via 'fileReadLineLimit' setting, initially 1000). When reading from the file system, only works within allowed directories. Can fetch content from URLs when isUrl parameter is set to true (URLs are always read in full regardless of offset/length). Handles text files normally and image files are returned as viewable images. Recognized image types: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP. IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths. This command can be referenced as "DC: ..." or "use Desktop Commander to ..." in your instructions.
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| isUrl | boolean | not set | No
| length | number | not set | No
| offset | number | not set | No
| path | string | not set | Yes
</details>
<details>
<summary>read_multiple_files</summary>

**Description**:

```
Read the contents of multiple files simultaneously. Each file's content is returned with its path as a reference. Handles text files normally and renders images as viewable content. Recognized image types: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP. Failed reads for individual files won't stop the entire operation. Only works within allowed directories. IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths. This command can be referenced as "DC: ..." or "use Desktop Commander to ..." in your instructions.

                        Files over the line limit (configurable via 'fileWriteLineLimit' setting) WILL BE REJECTED if not broken into chunks as described above.
                        Only works within allowed directories. IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths. This command can be referenced as "DC: ..." or "use Desktop Commander to ..." in your instructions.

<details>
<summary>edit_block</summary>

**Description**:

```
Apply surgical text replacements to files. 
                        BEST PRACTICE: Make multiple small, focused edits rather than one large edit. 
                        Each edit_block call should change only what needs to be changed - include just enough context to uniquely identify the text being modified. 
                        Takes file_path, old_string (text to replace), new_string (replacement text), and optional expected_replacements parameter. 
                        By default, replaces only ONE occurrence of the search text. 
                        To replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of matches expected. 
                        UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT: When expected_replacements=1 (default), include the minimal amount of context necessary (typically 1-3 lines) before and after the change point, with exact whitespace and indentation. 
                        When editing multiple sections, make separate edit_block calls for each distinct change rather than one large replacement. 
                        When a close but non-exact match is found, a character-level diff is shown in the format: common_prefix{-removed-}{+added+}common_suffix to help you identify what's different.
                        Similar to write_file, there is a configurable line limit (fileWriteLineLimit) that warns if the edited file exceeds this limit. If this happens, consider breaking your edits into smaller, more focused changes.
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths. This command can be referenced as "DC: ..." or "use Desktop Commander to ..." in your instructions.

<summary>execute_command</summary>

**Description**:

```
