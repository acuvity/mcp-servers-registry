# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Gardrails

### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

## Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.


To review the full policy, see it [here](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/docker/policy.rego). Alternatively, you can override the default policy or supply your own policy file to use (see [here](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/docker/entrypoint.sh) for Docker, [here](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-desktop-commander/charts/mcp-server-desktop-commander#minibridge) for Helm charts).

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

# Configuration through value file

## Replica Set Configuration

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
```

Controls how many pod replicas the ReplicaSet (or Deployment) will maintain.
- **replicaCount**: integer number of desired pods.


## Chart Name Overrides

```yaml
nameOverride: ""
fullnameOverride: ""
```

Allows you to override default naming:
- **nameOverride**: replaces chart name in resource names.
- **fullnameOverride**: replaces the full generated name (including release) for all resources.


## Image Configuration

```yaml
image:
  repository: map[host:docker.io org:acuvity]/mcp-server-desktop-commander
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: ""
```

Defines the container image to deploy:
- **repository**: Docker registry plus image name.
- **pullPolicy**: when Kubernetes should pull the image (`Always`, `IfNotPresent`, etc.).
- **tag**: image tag; defaults to the chart‚Äôs `appVersion` if left empty.


## Image Pull Secrets

```yaml
imagePullSecrets: []
```

List of Kubernetes Secret names for authenticating to private image registries. If your image is in a private repo, add its pull‚Äësecret here.


## Container Arguments

```yaml
args: []
```

Passes arbitrary command‚Äëline arguments into the container. This will override the default arguments set in the container.


## Service Account

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  automount: true
  annotations: {}
  name: ""
```

Configures the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used by the pods:
- **create**: whether to create a new ServiceAccount.
- **automount**: automatically mount its token into pods.
- **annotations**: add metadata to the ServiceAccount.
- **name**: explicit name; when empty and `create: true`, a name is generated.


## Annotations and Labels

```yaml
podAnnotations: {}

podLabels:
  app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp-server
  mcp-server-scope: native
```

- **podAnnotations**: free‚Äëform key/value map of Kubernetes annotations attached to each Pod.
- **podLabels**: key/value labels applied to each Pod; used for selection, organization, and tooling.


## Security Contexts

```yaml
podSecurityContext: {}

securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
```

Controls Linux security settings for the Pod and containers:
- **podSecurityContext**: settings applied at the Pod level (UID/GID, fsGroup, etc.).
- **securityContext** (container‚Äëlevel):
  - **capabilities.drop**: drop Linux capabilities for isolation.
  - **readOnlyRootFilesystem**: prevent writes to root.
  - **runAsNonRoot**: require non‚Äëroot user.
  - **runAsUser**: UID under which the container runs.


## Service Configuration

```yaml
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 8000
  healthPort: 8080
  sessionAffinity:
    sessionAffinity: ClientIP
    sessionAffinityConfig:
      clientIP:
        timeoutSeconds: 600
```

Defines the Kubernetes Service to front your pods:
- **type**: `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, etc.
- **port**: primary service port.
- **healthPort**: port used by health checks.
- **sessionAffinity**: stick client IPs to the same Pod for long‚Äëlived connections; **timeoutSeconds** controls session duration.


## Resource Requests and Limits

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
```

Specifies compute resource guarantees and caps:
- **requests**: minimum CPU/memory Kubernetes will reserve.
- **limits** (commented out by default): maximum CPU/memory the container may use.

## Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
```

Defines health checks:
- **livenessProbe**: when to restart a failed container.
- **readinessProbe**: when the Pod is ready to receive traffic.

Both use an HTTP GET on the `health` port.

## Autoscaling

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  # targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

Enables a HorizontalPodAutoscaler:

- **targetCPUUtilizationPercentage**: CPU usage threshold to scale.
- **targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage**: (optional) memory threshold.

## Volumes and Storage

```yaml
volumes: []
volumeMounts: []
storage:
```

Configures additional volumes and persistent storage:
- **volumes**: arbitrary Kubernetes `volume` entries to attach.
- **volumeMounts**: mount points inside containers.
- **storage**: iterates `package.storage` entries:
  - for persistent entries, creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `mcp-server-desktop-commander` with `storageClassName: <class>` and `resources.requests.storage: <size>`.

## Placement and Scheduling

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
```

Controls Pod scheduling to nodes:
- **nodeSelector**: simple key/value match to select nodes.
- **tolerations**: allow Pods to schedule onto tainted nodes.
- **affinity**: advanced rules (node or Pod affinity/anti‚Äëaffinity).

## Minibridge

        path:
      # Do not validate Policer CA. Do not do this in production
      # insecure: true
```

To enable guardrails you can set `minibridge.guardrails` list as:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 --set 'minibridge.guardrails={secrets-redaction}'
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  guardrails:
  - covert-instruction-detection
  - sensitive-pattern-detection
  - shadowing-pattern-detection
  - schema-misuse-prevention
  - cross-origin-tool-access
  - secrets-redaction
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

To enable basic auth:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 --set minibridge.basicAuth.value="supersecret"
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  basicAuth:
    value: "supersecret"
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-desktop-commander oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-desktop-commander --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

                        Has a default timeout of 30 seconds which can be customized using the timeoutMs parameter. 
                        Only searches within allowed directories. IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| path | string | not set | Yes
| pattern | string | not set | Yes
| timeoutMs | number | not set | No

<summary>search_code</summary>

**Description**:

```
Search for text/code patterns within file contents using ripgrep. 
                        Use this instead of 'execute_command' with grep/find for searching code content.
                        Fast and powerful search similar to VS Code search functionality. 
                        Supports regular expressions, file pattern filtering, and context lines. 
                        Has a default timeout of 30 seconds which can be customized. 
                        Only searches within allowed directories. 
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

<summary>get_file_info</summary>

**Description**:

```
Retrieve detailed metadata about a file or directory including size, creation time, last modified time, 
                        permissions, and type. 
                        Only works within allowed directories. IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

<details>
<summary>edit_block</summary>

**Description**:

```
Apply surgical text replacements to files. 
                        BEST PRACTICE: Make multiple small, focused edits rather than one large edit. 
                        Each edit_block call should change only what needs to be changed - include just enough context to uniquely identify the text being modified. 
                        Takes file_path, old_string (text to replace), new_string (replacement text), and optional expected_replacements parameter. 
                        By default, replaces only ONE occurrence of the search text. 
                        To replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of matches expected. 
                        UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT: When expected_replacements=1 (default), include the minimal amount of context necessary (typically 1-3 lines) before and after the change point, with exact whitespace and indentation. 
                        When editing multiple sections, make separate edit_block calls for each distinct change rather than one large replacement. 
                        When a close but non-exact match is found, a character-level diff is shown in the format: common_prefix{-removed-}{+added+}common_suffix to help you identify what's different. 
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

| file_path | string | not set | Yes
| new_string | string | not set | Yes

<details>
<summary>execute_command</summary>

**Description**:

```
Execute a terminal command with timeout. 
                        Command will continue running in background if it doesn't complete within timeout. 
                        NOTE: For file operations, prefer specialized tools like read_file, search_code, list_directory instead of cat, grep, or ls commands.
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths (starting with '/' or drive letter like 'C:\') for reliability. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.
