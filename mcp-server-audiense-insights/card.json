Most descriptions adequately explain functionality with 2-3 sentences and provide context about what data is returned. Parameter descriptions are generally clear about purpose and expected values. Some tools like 'get-audience-content' and 'compare-audience-influencers' provide excellent detail about return data structure and business logic. Minor gaps include less detailed explanations for simpler tools like 'get-reports' and 'get-categories', but overall documentation is comprehensive enough for effective usage.","score":"B"},
