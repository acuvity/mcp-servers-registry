**Description:** MCP server for Brave Search API integration

> [!NOTE]
> `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` has been repackaged by Acuvity from its original [sources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission—especially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search run reliably and safely.

## 🔐 Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>📦 Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously monitors for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Provides full supply chain transparency with embedded metadata and traceable build information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ Runtime Security</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement 🕵️, and simplifies orchestration.

Minibridge includes built-in guardrails to protect MCP server integrity and detect suspicious behavior:

- **Integrity via Hashing**: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of tool descriptors and runtime components.
- **Threat Detection**:
  - Detects hidden or covert instruction patterns.
  - Monitors for schema parameter misuse as potential exfiltration channels.
  - Flags unauthorized access to sensitive files or credentials.
  - Identifies tool shadowing and override attempts.
  - Enforces cross-origin and server-mismatch protection policies.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

# 📦 How to Use


> [!NOTE]
> Given mcp-server-brave-search scope of operation it can be hosted anywhere.

## 🐳 With Docker
**Environment variables:**
  - `BRAVE_API_KEY` required to be set


<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only -e BRAVE_API_KEY docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-brave-search:0.6.2`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -i --rm --read-only -e BRAVE_API_KEY docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-brave-search:0.6.2
```

Add `-p <localport>:8000` to expose the port.

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use something like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-brave-search": {
      "url": "http://localhost:<localport>/sse",
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-brave-search": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Of course there is plenty of other option that minibridge can provide.

Don't be shy to ask question either.

## ☁️ On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### Chart settings requirements

This chart requires some mandatory information to be installed.

**Mandatory Secrets**:
  - `BRAVE_API_KEY` secret to be set as secrets.BRAVE_API_KEY either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`

### How to install

Pick a version from the [OCI registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/acuvity/mcp-server-brave-search/tags) looking for the type `helm`

You can inspect the chart:

```console
helm show chart oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-brave-search --version <version>
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-brave-search --version <version>
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-brave-search oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-brave-search --version <version>
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-brave-search will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-brave-search` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.
