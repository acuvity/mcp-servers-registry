Most descriptions adequately explain functionality with 2-3 sentences and provide basic usage context. Parameter descriptions are generally clear with good detail about expected values and cross-references to other tools. Some tools like 'calculator' have excellent comprehensive descriptions, while others like 'wait_a_moment' and 'get_current_time' are more basic but adequate. Overall good documentation quality with minor gaps in some areas.","score":"B"},
