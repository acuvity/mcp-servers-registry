Descriptions are basic but functional - they explain what each tool does in 1-2 sentences. However, descriptions lack important context like when to use each tool, what information they provide, or key limitations (except for the APOC note). Parameter documentation is minimal but adequate, clearly indicating purpose and types. The toolset provides essential functionality but leaves users to infer usage patterns and constraints.","score":"C"},
