Tool names are clear and specific. Parameter documentation is generally thorough with most having clear descriptions and constraints. Some minor areas for improvement include: the route_table_ids parameter lacks a description, the filters parameter could be more specific about expected filter keys, and a few parameters could benefit from example values or format specifications.","score":"B"},
