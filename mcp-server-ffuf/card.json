The description is extremely minimal (one sentence) and fails to explain what ffuf is, when to use it, or what it accomplishes. While the ffuf_args parameter includes extensive technical documentation, this appears to be copy-pasted help text rather than contextual parameter guidance. The documentation lacks essential context about the tool's security testing purpose and provides no guidance on appropriate usage scenarios.","score":"D"},
