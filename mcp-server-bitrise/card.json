While most tools have appropriate names that indicate their purpose (e.g., 'list_apps', 'trigger_bitrise_build'), the descriptions are often too brief and miss important context about when to use them or what they return. Parameter documentation is generally clear but inconsistent - some tools like 'register_app' provide good context and usage guidance, while others like 'update_app' or 'get_cache_item_download_url' (which lacks a description entirely) provide minimal information. The toolset would benefit from more comprehensive descriptions explaining usage context, return expectations, and important limitations across all tools.","score":"C"},
