# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @circleci/mcp-server-circleci run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-circleci/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need.

| Guardrail                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `covert-instruction-detection`   | Detects hidden or obfuscated directives in requests.                    |
| `sensitive-pattern-detection`    | Flags patterns suggesting sensitive data or filesystem exposure.        |
| `shadowing-pattern-detection`    | Identifies tool descriptions that override or influence others.         |
| `schema-misuse-prevention`       | Enforces strict schema compliance on input data.                        |
| `cross-origin-tool-access`       | Controls calls to external services or APIs.                            |
| `secrets-redaction`              | Prevents exposure of credentials or sensitive values.                   |

Example: add `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction sensitive-pattern-detection"` to enable those guardrails.

## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, define `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with a shared secret.

Example: add `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"` to enable the basic authentication.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

image:
  repository: map[host:docker.io org:acuvity]/mcp-server-circleci
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: ""
```

Defines the container image to deploy:
- **repository**: Docker registry plus image name.
- **pullPolicy**: when Kubernetes should pull the image (`Always`, `IfNotPresent`, etc.).
- **tag**: image tag; defaults to the chart‚Äôs `appVersion` if left empty.


## Image Pull Secrets

```yaml
imagePullSecrets: []
```

List of Kubernetes Secret names for authenticating to private image registries. If your image is in a private repo, add its pull‚Äësecret here.


## Container Arguments

```yaml
args: []
```

Passes arbitrary command‚Äëline arguments into the container. This will override the default arguments set in the container.


## Service Account

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  automount: true
  annotations: {}
  name: ""
```

Configures the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used by the pods:
- **create**: whether to create a new ServiceAccount.
- **automount**: automatically mount its token into pods.
- **annotations**: add metadata to the ServiceAccount.
- **name**: explicit name; when empty and `create: true`, a name is generated.


## Annotations and Labels

```

Defines the Kubernetes Service to front your pods:
- **type**: `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, etc.
- **port**: primary service port.
- **healthPort**: port used by health checks.
- **sessionAffinity**: stick client IPs to the same Pod for long‚Äëlived connections; **timeoutSeconds** controls session duration.


## Resource Requests and Limits

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
```

Specifies compute resource guarantees and caps:
- **requests**: minimum CPU/memory Kubernetes will reserve.
- **limits** (commented out by default): maximum CPU/memory the container may use.

## Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
```

Defines health checks:
- **livenessProbe**: when to restart a failed container.
- **readinessProbe**: when the Pod is ready to receive traffic.

Both use an HTTP GET on the `health` port.

## Autoscaling

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  # targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80

- **targetCPUUtilizationPercentage**: CPU usage threshold to scale.
- **targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage**: (optional) memory threshold.

## Volumes and Storage

```yaml
volumes: []
volumeMounts: []
storage:
```

Configures additional volumes and persistent storage:
- **volumes**: arbitrary Kubernetes `volume` entries to attach.
- **volumeMounts**: mount points inside containers.
- **storage**: iterates `package.storage` entries:
  - for persistent entries, creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `mcp-server-circleci` with `storageClassName: <class>` and `resources.requests.storage: <size>`.

## Placement and Scheduling

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
```

Controls Pod scheduling to nodes:
- **nodeSelector**: simple key/value match to select nodes.

        path:
      # Do not validate Policer CA. Do not do this in production
      # insecure: true
```

To enable guardrails you can set `minibridge.guardrails` list as:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-circleci oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-circleci --version 1.0.0 --set 'minibridge.guardrails={secrets-redaction}'
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  guardrails:
  - covert-instruction-detection
  - sensitive-pattern-detection
  - shadowing-pattern-detection
  - schema-misuse-prevention
  - cross-origin-tool-access
  - secrets-redaction
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-circleci oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-circleci --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

To enable basic auth:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-circleci oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-circleci --version 1.0.0 --set minibridge.basicAuth.value="supersecret"
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  basicAuth:
    value: "supersecret"
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-circleci oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-circleci --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

<summary>get_build_failure_logs</summary>

**Description**:

```

    This tool helps debug CircleCI build failures by retrieving failure logs.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Truncation Handling (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
       - ALWAYS check for <MCPTruncationWarning> in the output
       - When present, you MUST start your response with:
         "WARNING: The logs have been truncated. Only showing the most recent entries. Earlier build failures may not be visible."
       - Only proceed with log analysis after acknowledging the truncation

    Input options (EXACTLY ONE of these THREE options must be used):

    Option 1 - Project Slug and branch (BOTH required):
    - projectSlug: The project slug obtained from listFollowedProjects tool (e.g., "gh/organization/project")
    - branch: The name of the branch (required when using projectSlug)

    Option 2 - Direct URL (provide ONE of these):
    - projectURL: The URL of the CircleCI project in any of these formats:
      * Project URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project
      * Pipeline URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123
      * Legacy Job URL: https://circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123
      * Workflow URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def
      * Job URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def/jobs/xyz

    Option 3 - Project Detection (ALL of these must be provided together):
    - workspaceRoot: The absolute path to the workspace root
    - gitRemoteURL: The URL of the git remote repository
    - branch: The name of the current branch
    
    Recommended Workflow:
    1. Use listFollowedProjects tool to get a list of projects
    2. Extract the projectSlug from the chosen project (format: "gh/organization/project")
    3. Use that projectSlug with a branch name for this tool

    Additional Requirements:
    - Never call this tool with incomplete parameters
    - If using Option 1, make sure to extract the projectSlug exactly as provided by listFollowedProjects
    - If using Option 2, the URLs MUST be provided by the user - do not attempt to construct or guess URLs
    - If using Option 3, ALL THREE parameters (workspaceRoot, gitRemoteURL, branch) must be provided
    - If none of the options can be fully satisfied, ask the user for the missing information before making the tool call
    
```

<summary>create_prompt_template</summary>

**Description**:

```

  ABOUT THIS TOOL:
  - This tool is part of a toolchain that generates and provides test cases for a prompt template.
  - This tool helps an AI assistant to generate a prompt template based on one of the following:
    1. feature requirements defined by a user - in which case the tool will generate a new prompt template based on the feature requirements.
    2. a pre-existing prompt or prompt template that a user wants to test, evaluate, or modify - in which case the tool will convert it into a more structured and testable prompt template while leaving the original prompt language relatively unchanged.
  - This tool will return a structured prompt template (e.g. `template`) along with a context schema (e.g. ``contextSchema``) that defines the expected input parameters for the prompt template.
  - In some cases, a user will want to add test coverage for ALL of the prompts in a given application. In these cases, the AI agent should use this tool to generate a prompt template for each prompt in the application, and should check the entire application for AI prompts that are not already covered by a prompt template in the `./prompts` directory.

  WHEN SHOULD THIS TOOL BE TRIGGERED?
  - This tool should be triggered whenever the user provides requirements for a new AI-enabled application or a new AI-enabled feature of an existing  application (i.e. one that requires a prompt request to an LLM or any AI model).
  - This tool should also be triggered if the user provides a pre-existing prompt or prompt template from their codebase that they want to test, evaluate, or modify.
  - This tool should be triggered even if there are pre-existing files in the `./prompts` directory with the `<relevant-name>.prompt.yml` convention (e.g. `bedtime-story-generator.prompt.yml`, `plant-care-assistant.prompt.yml`, `customer-support-chatbot.prompt.yml`, etc.). Similar files should NEVER be generated directly by the AI agent. Instead, the AI agent should use this tool to first generate a new prompt template.

  PARAMETERS:
  - params: object
    - prompt: string (the feature requirements or pre-existing prompt/prompt template that will be used to generate a prompt template. Can be a multi-line string.)
    - promptOrigin: "codebase" | "requirements" (indicates whether the prompt comes from an existing codebase or from new requirements)
    - model: string (the model that the prompt template will be tested against. Explicitly specify the model if it can be inferred from the codebase. Otherwise, defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`.)

  EXAMPLE USAGE (from new requirements):
  {
    "params": {
      "prompt": "Create an app that takes any topic and an age (in years), then renders a 1-minute bedtime story for a person of that age.",
      "promptOrigin": "requirements"
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
    }
  }

  EXAMPLE USAGE (from pre-existing prompt/prompt template in codebase):
  {
    "params": {
      "prompt": "The user wants a bedtime story about {{topic}} for a person of age {{age}} years old. Please craft a captivating tale that captivates their imagination and provides a delightful bedtime experience.",
      "promptOrigin": "codebase"
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
    }
  }

  TOOL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
  - The tool will return...
    - a `template` that reformulates the user's prompt into a more structured format.
    - a ``contextSchema`` that defines the expected input parameters for the template.
    - a `promptOrigin` that indicates whether the prompt comes from an existing prompt or prompt template in the user's codebase or from new requirements.
  - The tool output -- the `template`, ``contextSchema``, and `promptOrigin` -- will also be used as input to the `recommend_prompt_template_tests` tool to generate a list of recommended tests that can be used to test the prompt template.

<summary>list_followed_projects</summary>

**Description**:

```

    This tool lists all projects that the user is following on CircleCI.
    
    Common use cases:
    - Identify which CircleCI projects are available to the user
    - Select a project for subsequent operations
    - Obtain the projectSlug needed for other CircleCI tools
    
    Returns:
    - A list of projects that the user is following on CircleCI
    - Each entry includes the project name and its projectSlug
    
    Workflow:
    1. Run this tool to see available projects
    2. User selects a project from the list
    3. The LLM should extract and use the projectSlug (not the project name) from the selected project for subsequent tool calls
    4. The projectSlug is required for many other CircleCI tools, and will be used for those tool calls after a project is selected
    
    Note: If pagination limits are reached, the tool will indicate that not all projects could be displayed.
    
    IMPORTANT: Do not automatically run any additional tools after this tool is called. Wait for explicit user instruction before executing further tool calls. The LLM MUST NOT invoke any other CircleCI tools until receiving a clear instruction from the user about what to do next, even if the user selects a project. It is acceptable to list out tool call options for the user to choose from, but do not execute them until instructed.
