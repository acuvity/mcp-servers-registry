However, the descriptions are excessively verbose with redundant warnings and instructions that would be better handled by the system rather than documentation. Parameter descriptions are generally clear but inconsistent in detail. While the tools are broadly functional, the documentation could be significantly more concise and focused on essential usage information.","score":"C"},
