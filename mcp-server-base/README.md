**Description:** Base Network integration for onchain tools, allowing interaction with Base Network and Coinbase API for wallet management, fund transfers, smart contracts, and DeFi operations.

# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure base-mcp run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

Minibridge includes built-in guardrails that protect MCP server integrity and detect suspicious behaviors in real-time.:

- **Integrity Checks**: Ensures authenticity with runtime component hashing.
- **Threat Detection & Prevention with built-in Rego Policy**:
  - Covert‚Äêinstruction screening: Blocks any tool description or call arguments that match a wide list of "hidden prompt" phrases (e.g., "do not tell", "ignore previous instructions", Unicode steganography).
  - Schema-key misuse guard: Rejects tools or call arguments that expose internal-reasoning fields such as note, debug, context, etc., preventing jailbreaks that try to surface private metadata.
  - Sensitive-resource exposure check: Denies tools whose descriptions - or call arguments - reference paths, files, or patterns typically associated with secrets (e.g., .env, /etc/passwd, SSH keys).
  - Tool-shadowing detector: Flags wording like "instead of using" that might instruct an assistant to replace or override an existing tool with a different behavior.
  - Cross-tool ex-filtration filter: Scans responses and tool descriptions for instructions to invoke external tools not belonging to this server.
  - Credential / secret redaction mutator: Automatically replaces recognised tokens formats with `[REDACTED]` in outbound content.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

# üì¶ How to Use


> [!NOTE]
> Given mcp-server-base scope of operation it can be hosted anywhere.
> But keep in mind that this requires a peristent storage and that is might not be capable of serving mulitple clients at the same time.

# üß∞ Clients Integrations

Below are the steps for configuring most clients that use MCP to elevate their Copilot experience.

> [!NOTE]
> These integrations function natively across all Minibridge modes.
> To keep things brief, only the docker local-run setup is covered here.

</details>

## üê≥ Run it with Docker
**Environment variables:**
  - `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` required to be set
  - `CHAIN_ID` optional (not set)
  - `COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME` required to be set
  - `COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` required to be set
  - `COINBASE_PROJECT_ID` required to be set
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` required to be set
  - `PINATA_JWT` required to be set
  - `SEED_PHRASE` required to be set


<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only -e ALCHEMY_API_KEY -e COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME -e COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY -e COINBASE_PROJECT_ID -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY -e PINATA_JWT -e SEED_PHRASE docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-base:1.0.13`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -i --rm --read-only -e ALCHEMY_API_KEY -e COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME -e COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY -e COINBASE_PROJECT_ID -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY -e PINATA_JWT -e SEED_PHRASE docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-base:1.0.13
```

Add `-p <localport>:8000` to expose the port.

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use something like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-base": {
      "url": "http://localhost:<localport>/sse",
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familiar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-base": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Of course there are plenty of other options that minibridge can provide.

Don't be shy to ask question either.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### Chart settings requirements

This chart requires some mandatory information to be installed.

**Mandatory Secrets**:
  - `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` secret to be set as secrets.ALCHEMY_API_KEY either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`
  - `COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME` secret to be set as secrets.COINBASE_API_KEY_NAME either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`
  - `COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` secret to be set as secrets.COINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`
  - `COINBASE_PROJECT_ID` secret to be set as secrets.COINBASE_PROJECT_ID either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` secret to be set as secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`
  - `PINATA_JWT` secret to be set as secrets.PINATA_JWT either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`
  - `SEED_PHRASE` secret to be set as secrets.SEED_PHRASE either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`

**Optional Environment variables**:
  - `CHAIN_ID=""` environment variable can be changed with env.CHAIN_ID=""

### How to install

You can inspect the chart:

```console
helm show chart oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-base --version 1.0.0-
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-base --version 1.0.0
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-base oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-base --version 1.0.0
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-base will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-base` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will create a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.

See full charts [Readme](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-base/charts/mcp-server-base/README.md) for more details about settings.
