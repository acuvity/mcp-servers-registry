Most descriptions adequately explain functionality with 2-3 sentences and provide context about when to use each tool. Parameter descriptions are generally clear about purpose and expected input types. Some tools like get_hours_of_operation and update_hours provide excellent detail with examples, while others like get_blog_post are more minimal but still adequate. A few parameters lack complete descriptions (e.g., hours_type enum values, new_hours structure details), preventing an A grade.","score":"B"},
