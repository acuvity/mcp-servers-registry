# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure elevenlabs-mcp run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-elevenlabs/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Gardrails

### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

## Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.


To review the full policy, see it [here](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-elevenlabs/docker/policy.rego). Alternatively, you can override the default policy or supply your own policy file to use (see [here](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-elevenlabs/docker/entrypoint.sh) for Docker, [here](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-elevenlabs/charts/mcp-server-elevenlabs#minibridge) for Helm charts).

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

replicaCount: 1
```

Controls how many pod replicas the ReplicaSet (or Deployment) will maintain.
- **replicaCount**: integer number of desired pods.


## Chart Name Overrides

```yaml
nameOverride: ""
fullnameOverride: ""
```

Allows you to override default naming:
- **nameOverride**: replaces chart name in resource names.
- **fullnameOverride**: replaces the full generated name (including release) for all resources.


## Image Configuration

```yaml
image:
  repository: map[host:docker.io org:acuvity]/mcp-server-elevenlabs
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: ""
```

Defines the container image to deploy:
- **repository**: Docker registry plus image name.
- **pullPolicy**: when Kubernetes should pull the image (`Always`, `IfNotPresent`, etc.).
- **tag**: image tag; defaults to the chart‚Äôs `appVersion` if left empty.


## Image Pull Secrets

```yaml
imagePullSecrets: []
```

List of Kubernetes Secret names for authenticating to private image registries. If your image is in a private repo, add its pull‚Äësecret here.


## Container Arguments

```yaml
args: []
```

Passes arbitrary command‚Äëline arguments into the container. This will override the default arguments set in the container.


## Service Account

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  automount: true
  annotations: {}
  name: ""
```

Configures the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used by the pods:
- **create**: whether to create a new ServiceAccount.
- **automount**: automatically mount its token into pods.
- **annotations**: add metadata to the ServiceAccount.
- **name**: explicit name; when empty and `create: true`, a name is generated.


## Annotations and Labels

```yaml
podAnnotations: {}

podLabels:
  app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp-server
  mcp-server-scope: remote
```

- **podAnnotations**: free‚Äëform key/value map of Kubernetes annotations attached to each Pod.
- **podLabels**: key/value labels applied to each Pod; used for selection, organization, and tooling.

securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
```

Controls Linux security settings for the Pod and containers:
- **podSecurityContext**: settings applied at the Pod level (UID/GID, fsGroup, etc.).
- **securityContext** (container‚Äëlevel):
  - **capabilities.drop**: drop Linux capabilities for isolation.
  - **readOnlyRootFilesystem**: prevent writes to root.
  - **runAsNonRoot**: require non‚Äëroot user.
  - **runAsUser**: UID under which the container runs.


## Service Configuration

```yaml
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 8000
  healthPort: 8080
  sessionAffinity:
    sessionAffinity: ClientIP
    sessionAffinityConfig:

```

Defines the Kubernetes Service to front your pods:
- **type**: `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, etc.
- **port**: primary service port.
- **healthPort**: port used by health checks.
- **sessionAffinity**: stick client IPs to the same Pod for long‚Äëlived connections; **timeoutSeconds** controls session duration.


## Resource Requests and Limits

```yaml

  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
```

Specifies compute resource guarantees and caps:
- **requests**: minimum CPU/memory Kubernetes will reserve.
- **limits** (commented out by default): maximum CPU/memory the container may use.

## Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health

Defines health checks:
- **livenessProbe**: when to restart a failed container.
- **readinessProbe**: when the Pod is ready to receive traffic.

Both use an HTTP GET on the `health` port.

## Autoscaling

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  # targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80

- **targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage**: (optional) memory threshold.

## Volumes and Storage

```yaml
volumes: []
volumeMounts: []
storage:
```

Configures additional volumes and persistent storage:
- **volumes**: arbitrary Kubernetes `volume` entries to attach.
- **volumeMounts**: mount points inside containers.
- **storage**: iterates `package.storage` entries:
  - for persistent entries, creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `mcp-server-elevenlabs` with `storageClassName: <class>` and `resources.requests.storage: <size>`.

## Placement and Scheduling

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
```

Controls Pod scheduling to nodes:
- **nodeSelector**: simple key/value match to select nodes.
- **tolerations**: allow Pods to schedule onto tainted nodes.
- **affinity**: advanced rules (node or Pod affinity/anti‚Äëaffinity).

```

To enable guardrails you can set `minibridge.guardrails` list as:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-elevenlabs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-elevenlabs --version 1.0.0 --set 'minibridge.guardrails={secrets-redaction}'
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  guardrails:
  - covert-instruction-detection
  - sensitive-pattern-detection
  - shadowing-pattern-detection
  - schema-misuse-prevention
  - cross-origin-tool-access
  - secrets-redaction
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-elevenlabs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-elevenlabs --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

To enable basic auth:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-elevenlabs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-elevenlabs --version 1.0.0 --set minibridge.basicAuth.value="supersecret"
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  basicAuth:
    value: "supersecret"
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-elevenlabs oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-elevenlabs --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

## üß∞ Tools (19)
<details>
<summary>text_to_speech</summary>

**Description**:

```
Convert text to speech with a given voice and save the output audio file to a given directory.
    Directory is optional, if not provided, the output file will be saved to $HOME/Desktop.
    Only one of voice_id or voice_name can be provided. If none are provided, the default voice will be used.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è COST WARNING: This tool makes an API call to ElevenLabs which may incur costs. Only use when explicitly requested by the user.

     Args:
        text (str): The text to convert to speech.
        voice_name (str, optional): The name of the voice to use.
        stability (float, optional): Stability of the generated audio. Determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation. Lower values introduce broader emotional range for the voice. Higher values can result in a monotonous voice with limited emotion. Range is 0 to 1.
        similarity_boost (float, optional): Similarity boost of the generated audio. Determines how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice when attempting to replicate it. Range is 0 to 1.
        style (float, optional): Style of the generated audio. Determines the style exaggeration of the voice. This setting attempts to amplify the style of the original speaker. It does consume additional computational resources and might increase latency if set to anything other than 0. Range is 0 to 1.
        use_speaker_boost (bool, optional): Use speaker boost of the generated audio. This setting boosts the similarity to the original speaker. Using this setting requires a slightly higher computational load, which in turn increases latency.
        speed (float, optional): Speed of the generated audio. Controls the speed of the generated speech. Values range from 0.7 to 1.2, with 1.0 being the default speed. Lower values create slower, more deliberate speech while higher values produce faster-paced speech. Extreme values can impact the quality of the generated speech. Range is 0.7 to 1.2.
        output_directory (str, optional): Directory where files should be saved.
            Defaults to $HOME/Desktop if not provided.
        language: ISO 639-1 language code for the voice.
        output_format (str, optional): Output format of the generated audio. Formatted as codec_sample_rate_bitrate. So an mp3 with 22.05kHz sample rate at 32kbs is represented as mp3_22050_32. MP3 with 192kbps bitrate requires you to be subscribed to Creator tier or above. PCM with 44.1kHz sample rate requires you to be subscribed to Pro tier or above. Note that the Œº-law format (sometimes written mu-law, often approximated as u-law) is commonly used for Twilio audio inputs.
            Defaults to "mp3_44100_128". Must be one of:
            mp3_22050_32
            mp3_44100_32
            mp3_44100_64
            mp3_44100_96
            mp3_44100_128
            mp3_44100_192
            pcm_8000
            pcm_16000
            pcm_22050
            pcm_24000
            pcm_44100
            ulaw_8000
            alaw_8000
            opus_48000_32
            opus_48000_64
            opus_48000_96
            opus_48000_128
            opus_48000_192

    Returns:
        Text content with the path to the output file and name of the voice used.
    
```
