While parameter descriptions are generally clear and most tools have basic functional descriptions, many tool descriptions are too brief (1-2 words like 'List MongoDB Atlas clusters') and lack important context about usage, limitations, or expected outputs. Some tools like 'atlas-create-db-user' have comprehensive parameter documentation, but others like 'atlas-list-orgs' provide minimal guidance. The documentation is functional but leaves users with questions about when to use specific tools and what to expect from them.","score":"C"},
