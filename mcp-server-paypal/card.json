Tool names are clear and specific (e.g., 'create_invoice', 'send_invoice_reminder', 'generate_invoice_qr_code'). Most descriptions adequately explain functionality and usage context in 1-3 sentences. Parameter documentation is generally comprehensive with clear types, constraints, and purposes. However, some tools have inconsistencies: 'show_product_details' has a misleading description that doesn't match its function, several tools have overly verbose descriptions with unnecessary implementation details, and some parameter descriptions could be clearer. The overall quality is solid but falls short of excellence due to these inconsistencies and minor clarity issues.","score":"B"},
