Tool names are clear and purposeful (e.g., 'create_invoice', 'list_transactions', 'cancel_subscription'). Most descriptions provide adequate context about functionality and usage, though some vary in completeness - some are concise and effective while others like 'create_product' include excessive implementation details. Parameter documentation is generally strong with clear descriptions of purpose, types, and constraints including proper enums and required fields. However, there are minor inconsistencies like 'show_product_details' having a misleading description that doesn't match its actual function, and some tools could benefit from clearer usage context. The documentation would enable effective usage despite these small gaps.","score":"B"},
