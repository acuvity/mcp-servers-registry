Tool names effectively use the 'azmcp-' prefix convention and are descriptive. However, there are some inconsistencies: several parameters like 'auth-method' and retry parameters use integer types without enum constraints despite having specific option lists, and some tools have overly verbose descriptions that could be more concise. The parameter descriptions are generally clear and include examples where helpful, though type constraints could be better specified for enumerated values.","score":"B"},
