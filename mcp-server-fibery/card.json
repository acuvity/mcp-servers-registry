Most descriptions adequately explain functionality with good context, especially the complex query_database tool which includes comprehensive examples. Parameter descriptions are generally clear with proper type information. However, some tools like current_date and list_databases have overly brief descriptions that could benefit from more detail about when to use them and what they return.","score":"B"},
