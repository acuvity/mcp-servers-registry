Most tools have clear, descriptive names and adequate descriptions explaining their functionality. Parameter documentation is generally well-done with clear purposes and constraints specified. However, some descriptions are quite brief (like 'execute_sql' and basic schema tools) and could benefit from more context about usage scenarios and limitations. The complex tools like 'explain_query' and 'analyze_db_health' provide excellent detailed descriptions, while simpler tools are more minimal but still functional.","score":"B"},
