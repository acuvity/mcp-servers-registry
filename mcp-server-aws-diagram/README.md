# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

Minibridge includes built-in guardrails that protect MCP server integrity and detect suspicious behaviors in real-time.:

- **Integrity Checks**: Ensures authenticity with runtime component hashing.
- **Threat Detection & Prevention with built-in Rego Policy**:
  - Covert‚Äêinstruction screening: Blocks any tool description or call arguments that match a wide list of "hidden prompt" phrases (e.g., "do not tell", "ignore previous instructions", Unicode steganography).
  - Schema-key misuse guard: Rejects tools or call arguments that expose internal-reasoning fields such as note, debug, context, etc., preventing jailbreaks that try to surface private metadata.
  - Sensitive-resource exposure check: Denies tools whose descriptions - or call arguments - reference paths, files, or patterns typically associated with secrets (e.g., .env, /etc/passwd, SSH keys).
  - Tool-shadowing detector: Flags wording like "instead of using" that might instruct an assistant to replace or override an existing tool with a different behavior.
  - Cross-tool ex-filtration filter: Scans responses and tool descriptions for instructions to invoke external tools not belonging to this server.
  - Credential / secret redaction mutator: Automatically replaces recognised tokens formats with `[REDACTED]` in outbound content.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

<summary>OpenAI python SDK</summary>

## Running locally

```python
async with MCPServerStdio(
    params={
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run","-i","--rm","--read-only","docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram:0.9.3"]

```

## Running remotely

```python
async with MCPServerSse(
    params={
        "url": "http://<ip>:<port>/sse",
    }
) as server:
    tools = await server.list_tools()
```

See [OpenAI Agents SDK docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) for more info.

</details>

## üê≥ Run it with Docker


<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram:0.9.3`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -i --rm --read-only docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram:0.9.3
```

Add `-p <localport>:8000` to expose the port.

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use something like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-aws-diagram": {
      "url": "http://localhost:<localport>/sse",
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familiar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-aws-diagram": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Of course there are plenty of other options that minibridge can provide.

Don't be shy to ask question either.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### How to install

You can inspect the chart:

```console
helm show chart oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram --version 1.0.0-
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram --version 1.0.0
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-aws-diagram oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram --version 1.0.0
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-aws-diagram will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-aws-diagram` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will create a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.

See full charts [Readme](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-aws-diagram/charts/mcp-server-aws-diagram/README.md) for more details about settings.

# üß† Server features

## üß∞ Tools (3)
<details>
<summary>generate_diagram</summary>

**Description**:

```
Generate a diagram from Python code using the diagrams package.

    This tool accepts Python code as a string that uses the diagrams package DSL
    and generates a PNG diagram without displaying it. The code is executed with
    show=False to prevent automatic display.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    Never import. Start writing code immediately with `with Diagram(` and use the icons you found with list_icons.
    1. First use get_diagram_examples to understand the syntax and capabilities
    2. Then use list_icons to discover all available icons. These are the only icons you can work with.
    3. You MUST use icon names exactly as they are in the list_icons response, case-sensitive.
    4. Write your diagram code following python diagrams examples. Do not import any additional icons or packages, the runtime already imports everything needed.
    5. Submit your code to this tool to generate the diagram
    6. The tool returns the path to the generated PNG file
    7. For complex diagrams, consider using Clusters to organize components
    8. Diagrams should start with a user or end device on the left, with data flowing to the right.

    CODE REQUIREMENTS:
    - Must include a Diagram() definition with appropriate parameters
    - Can use any of the supported diagram components (AWS, K8s, etc.)
    - Can include custom styling with Edge attributes (color, style)
    - Can use Cluster to group related components
    - Can use custom icons with the Custom class

    COMMON PATTERNS:
    - Basic: provider.service("label")
    - Connections: service1 >> service2 >> service3
    - Grouping: with Cluster("name"): [components]
    - Styling: service1 >> Edge(color="red", style="dashed") >> service2

    IMPORTANT FOR CLINE: Always send the current workspace directory when calling this tool!
    The workspace_dir parameter should be set to the directory where the user is currently working
    so that diagrams are saved to a location accessible to the user.

    Supported diagram types:
    - AWS architecture diagrams
    - Sequence diagrams
    - Flow diagrams
    - Class diagrams
    - Kubernetes diagrams
    - On-premises diagrams
    - Custom diagrams with custom nodes

    Returns:
        Dictionary with the path to the generated diagram and status information
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| code | string | Python code using the diagrams package DSL. The runtime already imports everything needed so you can start immediately using `with Diagram(` | Yes
| filename | any | The filename to save the diagram to. If not provided, a random name will be generated. | No
| timeout | integer | The timeout for diagram generation in seconds. Default is 90 seconds. | No
| workspace_dir | any | The user's current workspace directory. CRITICAL: Client must always send the current workspace directory when calling this tool! If provided, diagrams will be saved to a 'generated-diagrams' subdirectory. | No
</details>
<details>
<summary>get_diagram_examples</summary>

**Description**:

```
Get example code for different types of diagrams.

    This tool provides ready-to-use example code for various diagram types.
    Use these examples to understand the syntax and capabilities of the diagrams package
    before creating your own custom diagrams.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Select the diagram type you're interested in (or 'all' to see all examples)
    2. Study the returned examples to understand the structure and syntax
    3. Use these examples as templates for your own diagrams
    4. When ready, modify an example or write your own code and use generate_diagram

    EXAMPLE CATEGORIES:
    - aws: AWS cloud architecture diagrams (basic services, grouped workers, clustered web services, Bedrock)
    - sequence: Process and interaction flow diagrams
    - flow: Decision trees and workflow diagrams
    - class: Object relationship and inheritance diagrams
    - k8s: Kubernetes architecture diagrams
    - onprem: On-premises infrastructure diagrams
    - custom: Custom diagrams with custom icons
    - all: All available examples across categories

    Each example demonstrates different features of the diagrams package:
    - Basic connections between components
    - Grouping with Clusters
    - Advanced styling with Edge attributes
    - Different layout directions
    - Multiple component instances
    - Custom icons and nodes

    Parameters:
        diagram_type (str): Type of diagram example to return. Options: aws, sequence, flow, class, k8s, onprem, custom, all

    Returns:

<details>
<summary>list_icons</summary>

**Description**:

```
List all available icons from the diagrams package.

    This tool dynamically inspects the diagrams package to find all available
    providers, services, and icons that can be used in diagrams.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Use this tool to discover all available icons in the diagrams package
    2. The response is organized by provider (aws, on-premises, etc.)
    3. Each provider contains services (compute, database, network, etc.)
    4. Each service contains a list of available icons

    Example:
    If the response shows:
    ```
    {'aws': {'compute': ['EC2', 'Lambda', ...]}}
    ```

    You can use these icons in your code:
    ```
    with Diagram('AWS Example'):
        EC2('web') >> Lambda('process')
    ```

    Returns:
        Dictionary with all available providers, services, and icons organized hierarchically
    
```
