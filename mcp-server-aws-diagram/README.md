# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-aws-diagram/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need.

| Guardrail                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `covert-instruction-detection`   | Detects hidden or obfuscated directives in requests.                    |
| `sensitive-pattern-detection`    | Flags patterns suggesting sensitive data or filesystem exposure.        |
| `shadowing-pattern-detection`    | Identifies tool descriptions that override or influence others.         |
| `schema-misuse-prevention`       | Enforces strict schema compliance on input data.                        |
| `cross-origin-tool-access`       | Controls calls to external services or APIs.                            |
| `secrets-redaction`              | Prevents exposure of credentials or sensitive values.                   |

Example: add `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction sensitive-pattern-detection"` to enable those guardrails.

## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, define `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with a shared secret.

Example: add `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"` to enable the basic authentication.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

    }
) as server:
    tools = await server.list_tools()
```

See [OpenAI Agents SDK docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) for more info.

</details>

## üê≥ Run it with Docker

<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram:1.0.1`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --rm --read-only docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram:1.0.1
```

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use it like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-aws-diagram": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familiar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-aws-diagram": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Minibridge offers a host of additional features. For step-by-step guidance, please visit the wiki. And if anything‚Äôs unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### How to install

You can inspect the chart `README`:

```console
helm show readme oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram --version 1.0.0
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram --version 1.0.0
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-aws-diagram oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-aws-diagram --version 1.0.0
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-aws-diagram will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-aws-diagram` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will create a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.

See full charts [Readme](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-aws-diagram/charts/mcp-server-aws-diagram/README.md) for more details about settings and runtime security including guardrails activation.

# üß† Server features

## üß∞ Tools (3)
<details>
<summary>generate_diagram</summary>

**Description**:

```
Generate a diagram from Python code using the diagrams package.

    This tool accepts Python code as a string that uses the diagrams package DSL
    and generates a PNG diagram without displaying it. The code is executed with
    show=False to prevent automatic display.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    Never import. Start writing code immediately with `with Diagram(` and use the icons you found with list_icons.
    1. First use get_diagram_examples to understand the syntax and capabilities
    2. Then use list_icons to discover all available icons. These are the only icons you can work with.
    3. You MUST use icon names exactly as they are in the list_icons response, case-sensitive.
    4. Write your diagram code following python diagrams examples. Do not import any additional icons or packages, the runtime already imports everything needed.
    5. Submit your code to this tool to generate the diagram
    6. The tool returns the path to the generated PNG file
    7. For complex diagrams, consider using Clusters to organize components
    8. Diagrams should start with a user or end device on the left, with data flowing to the right.

    CODE REQUIREMENTS:
    - Must include a Diagram() definition with appropriate parameters
    - Can use any of the supported diagram components (AWS, K8s, etc.)
    - Can include custom styling with Edge attributes (color, style)
    - Can use Cluster to group related components
    - Can use custom icons with the Custom class

    COMMON PATTERNS:
    - Basic: provider.service("label")
    - Connections: service1 >> service2 >> service3
    - Grouping: with Cluster("name"): [components]
    - Styling: service1 >> Edge(color="red", style="dashed") >> service2

    IMPORTANT FOR CLINE: Always send the current workspace directory when calling this tool!
    The workspace_dir parameter should be set to the directory where the user is currently working
    so that diagrams are saved to a location accessible to the user.

    Supported diagram types:
    - AWS architecture diagrams
    - Sequence diagrams
    - Flow diagrams
    - Class diagrams
    - Kubernetes diagrams
    - On-premises diagrams
    - Custom diagrams with custom nodes

    Returns:
        Dictionary with the path to the generated diagram and status information
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| code | string | Python code using the diagrams package DSL. The runtime already imports everything needed so you can start immediately using `with Diagram(` | Yes
| filename | any | The filename to save the diagram to. If not provided, a random name will be generated. | No
| timeout | integer | The timeout for diagram generation in seconds. Default is 90 seconds. | No
| workspace_dir | any | The user's current workspace directory. CRITICAL: Client must always send the current workspace directory when calling this tool! If provided, diagrams will be saved to a 'generated-diagrams' subdirectory. | No
</details>
<details>
<summary>get_diagram_examples</summary>

**Description**:

```
Get example code for different types of diagrams.

    This tool provides ready-to-use example code for various diagram types.
    Use these examples to understand the syntax and capabilities of the diagrams package
    before creating your own custom diagrams.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Select the diagram type you're interested in (or 'all' to see all examples)
    2. Study the returned examples to understand the structure and syntax
    3. Use these examples as templates for your own diagrams
    4. When ready, modify an example or write your own code and use generate_diagram

    EXAMPLE CATEGORIES:
    - aws: AWS cloud architecture diagrams (basic services, grouped workers, clustered web services, Bedrock)
    - sequence: Process and interaction flow diagrams
    - flow: Decision trees and workflow diagrams
    - class: Object relationship and inheritance diagrams
    - k8s: Kubernetes architecture diagrams
    - onprem: On-premises infrastructure diagrams
    - custom: Custom diagrams with custom icons
    - all: All available examples across categories

    Each example demonstrates different features of the diagrams package:
    - Basic connections between components
    - Grouping with Clusters
    - Advanced styling with Edge attributes
    - Different layout directions
    - Multiple component instances
    - Custom icons and nodes

    Parameters:
        diagram_type (str): Type of diagram example to return. Options: aws, sequence, flow, class, k8s, onprem, custom, all

    Returns:
        Dictionary with example code for the requested diagram type(s), organized by example name
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| diagram_type | any | Type of diagram example to return. Options: aws, sequence, flow, class, k8s, onprem, custom, all | No
</details>
<details>
<summary>list_icons</summary>

**Description**:

```
List available icons from the diagrams package, with optional filtering.

    This tool dynamically inspects the diagrams package to find available
    providers, services, and icons that can be used in diagrams.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Call without filters to get a list of available providers
    2. Call with provider_filter to get all services and icons for that provider
    3. Call with both provider_filter and service_filter to get icons for a specific service

    Example workflow:
    - First call: list_icons() ‚Üí Returns all available providers
    - Second call: list_icons(provider_filter="aws") ‚Üí Returns all AWS services and icons
    - Third call: list_icons(provider_filter="aws", service_filter="compute") ‚Üí Returns AWS compute icons

    This approach is more efficient than loading all icons at once, especially when you only need
    icons from specific providers or services.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with available providers, services, and icons organized hierarchically
    
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| provider_filter | any | Filter icons by provider name (e.g., "aws", "gcp", "k8s") | No
| service_filter | any | Filter icons by service name (e.g., "compute", "database", "network") | No
