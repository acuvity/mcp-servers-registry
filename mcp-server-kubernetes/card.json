Most tools have well-documented parameters with clear descriptions and appropriate constraints. However, some tools like 'cleanup' and 'port_forward' have minimal descriptions, and a few parameters lack sufficient detail about their purpose and usage context. The documentation is generally functional but could benefit from more comprehensive descriptions for complex operations.","score":"B"},
