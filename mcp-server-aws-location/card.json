Most descriptions explain functionality and include helpful context about AWS Location Service integration. However, descriptions vary in completeness - some are comprehensive while others are brief. The calculate_route tool stands out with detailed parameter explanations in both description and schema, while others like get_place could benefit from more context about when to use them versus alternatives.","score":"B"},
