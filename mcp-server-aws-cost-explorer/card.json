Tool names are specific and intuitive. The main tool 'get_cost_and_usage' provides excellent detail including usage examples and important behavioral notes. Parameter descriptions are thorough with examples and constraints clearly specified. Minor deductions for some repetitive boilerplate (Args/Returns sections from docstrings) and the 'get_today_date' tool having a somewhat generic name, but overall the toolset provides strong guidance for users.","score":"B"},
