The 'introspect_admin_schema' and 'get_started' tools provide reasonable context and usage guidance, but 'search_dev_docs' and 'fetch_docs_by_path' have overly brief descriptions that leave key details unclear. Parameter documentation is generally adequate but inconsistent, with some parameters well-explained and others lacking sufficient detail about expected formats or constraints.","score":"C"},
