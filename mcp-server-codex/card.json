Most descriptions are concise (1-2 sentences) and explain core functionality adequately. Parameter descriptions are generally clear with good type information and constraints. However, descriptions could be more comprehensive - they lack guidance on when to use tools, what information is vs isn't provided, and important limitations. Some tools like 'filter_tokens' have very brief descriptions despite complex schemas. The extensive use of JSON Schema references shows good structure but some parameter descriptions rely heavily on references rather than standalone clarity.","score":"B"},
