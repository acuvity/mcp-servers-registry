# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @triplewhale/mcp-server-triplewhale run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-triplewhale/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need.

| Guardrail                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `covert-instruction-detection`   | Detects hidden or obfuscated directives in requests.                    |
| `sensitive-pattern-detection`    | Flags patterns suggesting sensitive data or filesystem exposure.        |
| `shadowing-pattern-detection`    | Identifies tool descriptions that override or influence others.         |
| `schema-misuse-prevention`       | Enforces strict schema compliance on input data.                        |
| `cross-origin-tool-access`       | Controls calls to external services or APIs.                            |
| `secrets-redaction`              | Prevents exposure of credentials or sensitive values.                   |

Example: add `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction sensitive-pattern-detection"` to enable those guardrails.

## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, define `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with a shared secret.

Example: add `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"` to enable the basic authentication.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.


# üì¶ How to Install


> [!TIP]
> Given mcp-server-triplewhale scope of operation it can be hosted anywhere.

**Environment variables and secrets:**
  - `TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY` required to be set

    }
) as server:
    tools = await server.list_tools()
```

See [OpenAI Agents SDK docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) for more info.

</details>

## üê≥ Run it with Docker

<details>
<summary>Locally with STDIO</summary>

In your client configuration set:

- command: `docker`
- arguments: `run -i --rm --read-only -e TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-triplewhale:0.0.6`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Locally with HTTP/sse</summary>

Simply run as:

```console
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --rm --read-only -e TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-triplewhale:0.0.6
```

Then on your application/client, you can configure to use it like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-triplewhale": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to use different ports for different tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Remotely with Websocket tunneling and MTLS </summary>

> This section assume you are familiar with TLS and certificates and will require:
> - a server certificate with proper DNS/IP field matching your tool deployment.
> - a client-ca used to sign client certificates

1. Start the server in `backend` mode
 - add an environment variable like `-e MINIBRIDGE_MODE=backend`
 - add the TLS certificates (recommended) through a volume let's say `/certs` ex (`-v $PWD/certs:/certs`)
 - instruct minibridge to use those certs with
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CERT=/certs/server-cert.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY=/certs/server-key.pem`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_KEY_PASS=optional`
   - `-e MINIBRIDGE_TLS_SERVER_CLIENT_CA=/certs/client-ca.pem`

2. Start `minibridge` locally in frontend mode:
  - Get [minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) binary for your OS.

In your client configuration, Minibridge works like any other STDIO command.

Example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acuvity-mcp-server-triplewhale": {
      "command": "minibridge",
      "args": ["frontend", "--backend", "wss://<remote-url>:8000/ws", "--tls-client-backend-ca", "/path/to/ca/that/signed/the/server-cert.pem/ca.pem", "--tls-client-cert", "/path/to/client-cert.pem", "--tls-client-key", "/path/to/client-key.pem"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it.

Minibridge offers a host of additional features. For step-by-step guidance, please visit the wiki. And if anything‚Äôs unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy On Kubernetes

<details>
<summary>Deploy using Helm Charts</summary>

### Chart settings requirements

This chart requires some mandatory information to be installed.

**Mandatory Secrets**:
  - `TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY` secret to be set as secrets.TRIPLEWHALE_API_KEY either by `.value` or from existing with `.valueFrom`

### How to install

You can inspect the chart `README`:

```console
helm show readme oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-triplewhale --version 1.0.0
````

You can inspect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-triplewhale --version 1.0.0
````

Install with helm

```console
helm install mcp-server-triplewhale oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-triplewhale --version 1.0.0
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-triplewhale will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-triplewhale` on port `8000` by default. You can change that by looking at the `service` section of the `values.yaml` file.

### How to Monitor

The deployment will create a Kubernetes service with a `healthPort`, that is used for liveness probes and readiness probes. This health port can also be used by the monitoring stack of your choice and exposes metrics under the `/metrics` path.

See full charts [Readme](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-triplewhale/charts/mcp-server-triplewhale/README.md) for more details about settings and runtime security including guardrails activation.

- The tool parses the **responses** array and presents answers sequentially.
- If `isError` is `true` in any response, the entire message is considered an error, and the error message is displayed.
- The `assistantConclusion` is included at the end to summarize the results.


- **For each valid response:**
  - Show the **question**.
  - Present the **answer** data in a clear, structured format.
  - Mention that the data is available in the recommended visualization format (if provided in `assistant`).
  - If similar reports are suggested in the `assistant`, provide links.
  - Ask if the user needs further assistance using the assistantConclusion from the response.

  </response-handling>


  <example>
    For a migration like:
    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login TIMESTAMP;
    
    You should test it with:
    SELECT column_name, data_type 
    FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'last_login';
    
    You can use 'run_sql' to test the migration in the temporary branch that this
    tool creates.
  </example>

  <error_handling>
 - If `isError: true`, display the error message to the user.
- If the API returns `403 Unauthorized`, inform the user: "Invalid credentials. Please check your settings."
- If the `shopId` is missing, prompt the user to enter it.
- For other errors, respond with: "Something went wrong. Please try again later."

If the API return 401 it means the API key is invalid, this means the api ket doesn't have access to the shop so just say that api key is expired or doesn't have access to the shop.
  </error_handling>
