Most descriptions adequately explain functionality with 2-3 sentences covering what the tool does and when to use it. Parameter descriptions are comprehensive with good examples and context. However, some tools like 'get_transaction_receipt' and 'estimate_gas' have minimal descriptions, and there's some redundancy with similar tools (get_erc20_balance vs get_token_balance_erc20, transfer_erc20 vs transfer_token) that could confuse usage scenarios.","score":"B"},
