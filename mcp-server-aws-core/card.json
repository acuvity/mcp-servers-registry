The description is confusing with conflicting information - it claims to be for 'prompt understanding' but then mentions 'AWS expert advice' without explaining the connection. The input schema has no parameters but no explanation of how the tool works without inputs. The description lacks clarity about what the tool actually does or returns.","score":"D"},
