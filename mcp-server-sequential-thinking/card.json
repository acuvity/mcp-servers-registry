However, parameter documentation is inconsistent - while some parameters have clear descriptions (thought, thoughtNumber), others are too brief (branchId, needsMoreThoughts) given the tool's complexity. The mismatch between parameter names in the description (snake_case) and schema (camelCase) also reduces clarity.","score":"B"},
