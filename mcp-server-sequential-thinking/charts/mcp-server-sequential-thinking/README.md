**Description:** MCP server for sequential thinking and problem solving

> [!NOTE]
> `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` has been repackaged by Acuvity from its original [sources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously monitors for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Provides full supply chain transparency with embedded metadata and traceable build information.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

Minibridge includes built-in guardrails to protect MCP server integrity and detect suspicious behavior:

- **Integrity via Hashing**: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of tool descriptors and runtime components.
- **Threat Detection**:
  - Detects hidden or covert instruction patterns.
  - Monitors for schema parameter misuse as potential exfiltration channels.
  - Flags unauthorized access to sensitive files or credentials.
  - Identifies tool shadowing and override attempts.
  - Enforces cross-origin and server-mismatch protection policies.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

# How to install

Pick a version from the [OCI registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking/tags) looking for the type `helm`

You can inspect the chart:

```console
helm show chart oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version <version>
````

You can inpect the values that you can configure:

```console
helm show values oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version <version>
````

Install will helm

```console
helm install helm install mcp-server-sequential-thinking oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version <version>
```

From there your MCP server mcp-server-sequential-thinking will be reachable by default through `http/sse` from inside the cluster using the Kubernetes Service `mcp-server-sequential-thinking` on port `8000` by default.


# Configuration through value file

## Replica Set Configuration

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
```

Controls how many pod replicas the ReplicaSet (or Deployment) will maintain.
- **replicaCount**: integer number of desired pods.


## Chart Name Overrides

```yaml
nameOverride: ""
fullnameOverride: ""
```

Allows you to override default naming:
- **nameOverride**: replaces chart name in resource names.
- **fullnameOverride**: replaces the full generated name (including release) for all resources.


## Image Configuration

```yaml
image:
  repository: map[host:docker.io org:acuvity]/mcp-server-sequential-thinking
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: ""
```

Defines the container image to deploy:
- **repository**: Docker registry plus image name.
- **pullPolicy**: when Kubernetes should pull the image (`Always`, `IfNotPresent`, etc.).
- **tag**: image tag; defaults to the chart‚Äôs `appVersion` if left empty.


## Image Pull Secrets

```yaml
imagePullSecrets: []
```

List of Kubernetes Secret names for authenticating to private image registries. If your image is in a private repo, add its pull‚Äësecret here.


## Container Arguments

```yaml
args:
```

Passes arbitrary command‚Äëline arguments into the container.


## Service Account

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  automount: true
  annotations: {}
  name: ""
```

Configures the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used by the pods:
- **create**: whether to create a new ServiceAccount.
- **automount**: automatically mount its token into pods.
- **annotations**: add metadata to the ServiceAccount.
- **name**: explicit name; when empty and `create: true`, a name is generated.


## Annotations and Labels

```yaml
podAnnotations: {}

podLabels:
  app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp-server
  mcp-server-scope: standalone
```

- **podAnnotations**: free‚Äëform key/value map of Kubernetes annotations attached to each Pod.
- **podLabels**: key/value labels applied to each Pod; used for selection, organization, and tooling.


## Security Contexts

```yaml
podSecurityContext: {}

securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
```

Controls Linux security settings for the Pod and containers:
- **podSecurityContext**: settings applied at the Pod level (UID/GID, fsGroup, etc.).
- **securityContext** (container‚Äëlevel):
  - **capabilities.drop**: drop Linux capabilities for isolation.
  - **readOnlyRootFilesystem**: prevent writes to root.
  - **runAsNonRoot**: require non‚Äëroot user.
  - **runAsUser**: UID under which the container runs.


## Service Configuration

```yaml
service:

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
```

Specifies compute resource guarantees and caps:
- **requests**: minimum CPU/memory Kubernetes will reserve.
- **limits** (commented out by default): maximum CPU/memory the container may use.

## Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
```

Defines health checks:
- **livenessProbe**: when to restart a failed container.
- **readinessProbe**: when the Pod is ready to receive traffic.

Both use an HTTP GET on the `health` port.

## Autoscaling

  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  # targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

Enables a HorizontalPodAutoscaler:
- **enabled**: toggle autoscaling.
- **minReplicas**, **maxReplicas**: bounds on replicas.
- **targetCPUUtilizationPercentage**: CPU usage threshold to scale.
- **targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage**: (optional) memory threshold.

## Volumes and Storage

```yaml
volumes: []
volumeMounts: []
storage:
```

Configures additional volumes and persistent storage:
- **volumes**: arbitrary Kubernetes `volume` entries to attach.
- **volumeMounts**: mount points inside containers.
- **storage**: iterates `package.storage` entries:
  - for persistent entries, creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `mcp-server-sequential-thinking` with `storageClassName: <class>` and `resources.requests.storage: <size>`.

## Placement and Scheduling

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
```

Controls Pod scheduling to nodes:
- **nodeSelector**: simple key/value match to select nodes.
- **tolerations**: allow Pods to schedule onto tainted nodes.
- **affinity**: advanced rules (node or Pod affinity/anti‚Äëaffinity).

# üß† Server features

## üß∞ Tools (1)
<details>
<summary>sequentialthinking</summary>

**Description**:

```
A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached
```
