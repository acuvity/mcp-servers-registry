# Why We Built This

At [Acuvity](https://acuvity.ai), security is central to our mission‚Äîespecially for critical systems like MCP servers and integration in agentic systems.
To address this need, we've created a secure and robust Docker image designed to ensure @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking run reliably and safely.

## üîê Key Security Features

<details>
<summary>üì¶ Isolated Immutable Sandbox </summary>

- **Isolated Execution**: All tools run within secure, containerized sandboxes to enforce process isolation and prevent lateral movement.
- **Non-root by Default**: Enforces least-privilege principles, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Ensures runtime immutability, preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Version Pinning**: Guarantees consistency and reproducibility across deployments by locking tool and dependency versions.
- **CVE Scanning**: Continuously scans images for known vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/) to support proactive mitigation.
- **SBOM & Provenance**: Delivers full supply chain transparency by embedding metadata and traceable build information."
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security and Guardrails</summary>

**Minibridge Integration**: [Minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) establishes secure Agent-to-MCP connectivity, supports Rego/HTTP-based policy enforcement üïµÔ∏è, and simplifies orchestration.

The [ARC](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main) container includes a [built-in Rego policy](https://github.com/acuvity/mcp-servers-registry/tree/main/mcp-server-sequential-thinking/docker/policy.rego) that enables a set of runtime "guardrails"" to help enforce security, privacy, and correct usage of your services. Below is an overview of each guardrail provided.

### üîí Resource Integrity

**Mitigates MCP Rug Pull Attacks**

* **Goal:** Protect users from malicious tool description changes after initial approval, preventing post-installation manipulation or deception.
* **Mechanism:** Locks tool descriptions upon client approval and verifies their integrity before execution. Any modification to the description triggers a security violation, blocking unauthorized changes from server-side updates.

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails

#### Covert Instruction Detection

Monitors incoming requests for hidden or obfuscated directives that could alter policy behavior.

* **Goal:** Stop attackers from slipping unnoticed commands or payloads into otherwise harmless data.
* **Mechanism:** Applies a library of regex patterns and binary‚Äêencoding checks to the full request body. If any pattern matches a known covert channel (e.g., steganographic markers, hidden HTML tags, escape-sequence tricks), the request is rejected.

#### Sensitive Pattern Detection

Block user-defined sensitive data patterns (credential paths, filesystem references).

* **Goal:** Block accidental or malicious inclusion of sensitive information that violates data-handling rules.
* **Mechanism:** Runs a curated set of regexes against all payloads and tool descriptions‚Äîmatching patterns such as `.env` files, RSA key paths, directory traversal sequences.

#### Shadowing Pattern Detection

Detects and blocks "shadowing" attacks, where a malicious MCP server sneaks hidden directives into its own tool descriptions to hijack or override the behavior of other, trusted tools.

* **Goal:** Stop a rogue server from poisoning the agent‚Äôs logic by embedding instructions that alter how a different server‚Äôs tools operate (e.g., forcing all emails to go to an attacker‚Äôs address even when the user calls a separate `send_email` tool).
* **Mechanism:** During policy load, each tool description is scanned for cross‚Äêtool override patterns‚Äîsuch as `<IMPORTANT>` sections referencing other tool names, hidden side‚Äêeffects, or directives that apply to a different server‚Äôs API. Any description that attempts to shadow or extend instructions for a tool outside its own namespace triggers a policy violation and is rejected.

#### Schema Misuse Prevention

Enforces strict adherence to MCP input schemas.

* **Goal:** Prevent malformed or unexpected fields from bypassing validations, causing runtime errors, or enabling injections.
* **Mechanism:** Compares each incoming JSON object against the declared schema (required properties, allowed keys, types). Any extra, missing, or mistyped field triggers an immediate policy violation.

#### Cross-Origin Tool Access

Controls whether tools may invoke tools or services from external origins.

* **Goal:** Prevent untrusted or out-of-scope services from being called.
* **Mechanism:** Examines tool invocation requests and outgoing calls, verifying each target against an allowlist of approved domains or service names. Calls to any non-approved origin are blocked.

#### Secrets Redaction

Automatically masks sensitive values so they never appear in logs or responses.

* **Goal:** Ensure that API keys, tokens, passwords, and other credentials cannot leak in plaintext.
* **Mechanism:** Scans every text output for known secret formats (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub PATs, JWTs). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` before the response is sent or recorded.

These controls ensure robust runtime integrity, prevent unauthorized behavior, and provide a foundation for secure-by-design system operations.

### Enable guardrails

To activate guardrails in your Docker containers, define the `GUARDRAILS` environment variable with the protections you need.

| Guardrail                        | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `covert-instruction-detection`   | Detects hidden or obfuscated directives in requests.                    |
| `sensitive-pattern-detection`    | Flags patterns suggesting sensitive data or filesystem exposure.        |
| `shadowing-pattern-detection`    | Identifies tool descriptions that override or influence others.         |
| `schema-misuse-prevention`       | Enforces strict schema compliance on input data.                        |
| `cross-origin-tool-access`       | Controls calls to external services or APIs.                            |
| `secrets-redaction`              | Prevents exposure of credentials or sensitive values.                   |

Example: add `-e GUARDRAILS="secrets-redaction sensitive-pattern-detection"` to enable those guardrails.

## üîí Basic Authentication via Shared Secret

Provides a lightweight auth layer using a single shared token.

* **Mechanism:** Expects clients to send an `Authorization` header with the predefined secret.
* **Use Case:** Quickly lock down your endpoint in development or simple internal deployments‚Äîno complex OAuth/OIDC setup required.

To turn on Basic Authentication, define `BASIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable with a shared secret.

Example: add `-e BASIC_AUTH_SECRET="supersecret"` to enable the basic authentication.

> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all guardrails are turned off. You can enable or disable each one individually, ensuring that only the protections your environment needs are active.

replicaCount: 1
```

Controls how many pod replicas the ReplicaSet (or Deployment) will maintain.
- **replicaCount**: integer number of desired pods.


## Chart Name Overrides

```yaml
nameOverride: ""

```

Allows you to override default naming:
- **nameOverride**: replaces chart name in resource names.
- **fullnameOverride**: replaces the full generated name (including release) for all resources.


## Image Configuration

```yaml
image:
  repository: map[host:docker.io org:acuvity]/mcp-server-sequential-thinking
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: ""
```

Defines the container image to deploy:
- **repository**: Docker registry plus image name.
- **pullPolicy**: when Kubernetes should pull the image (`Always`, `IfNotPresent`, etc.).
- **tag**: image tag; defaults to the chart‚Äôs `appVersion` if left empty.


## Image Pull Secrets

```yaml
imagePullSecrets: []
```

List of Kubernetes Secret names for authenticating to private image registries. If your image is in a private repo, add its pull‚Äësecret here.


## Container Arguments

```yaml
args: []
```

Passes arbitrary command‚Äëline arguments into the container. This will override the default arguments set in the container.


## Service Account

```yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  automount: true
  annotations: {}
  name: ""
```

Configures the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used by the pods:
- **create**: whether to create a new ServiceAccount.
- **automount**: automatically mount its token into pods.
- **annotations**: add metadata to the ServiceAccount.
- **name**: explicit name; when empty and `create: true`, a name is generated.


## Annotations and Labels

```yaml
podAnnotations: {}

podLabels:
  app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp-server
  mcp-server-scope: standalone
```

- **podAnnotations**: free‚Äëform key/value map of Kubernetes annotations attached to each Pod.
- **podLabels**: key/value labels applied to each Pod; used for selection, organization, and tooling.


## Security Contexts

        timeoutSeconds: 600
```

Defines the Kubernetes Service to front your pods:
- **type**: `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, etc.
- **port**: primary service port.
- **healthPort**: port used by health checks.
- **sessionAffinity**: stick client IPs to the same Pod for long‚Äëlived connections; **timeoutSeconds** controls session duration.


## Resource Requests and Limits

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
```

Specifies compute resource guarantees and caps:
- **requests**: minimum CPU/memory Kubernetes will reserve.
- **limits** (commented out by default): maximum CPU/memory the container may use.

## Probes

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: health
```

Defines health checks:
- **livenessProbe**: when to restart a failed container.
- **readinessProbe**: when the Pod is ready to receive traffic.

Both use an HTTP GET on the `health` port.

## Autoscaling

```yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 100
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
  # targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

Enables a HorizontalPodAutoscaler:
- **enabled**: toggle autoscaling.
- **minReplicas**, **maxReplicas**: bounds on replicas.
- **targetCPUUtilizationPercentage**: CPU usage threshold to scale.
- **targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage**: (optional) memory threshold.

## Volumes and Storage

```yaml
volumes: []
volumeMounts: []
storage:
```

Configures additional volumes and persistent storage:
- **volumes**: arbitrary Kubernetes `volume` entries to attach.
- **volumeMounts**: mount points inside containers.
- **storage**: iterates `package.storage` entries:
  - for persistent entries, creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `mcp-server-sequential-thinking` with `storageClassName: <class>` and `resources.requests.storage: <size>`.

## Placement and Scheduling

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []
affinity: {}
```

Controls Pod scheduling to nodes:
- **nodeSelector**: simple key/value match to select nodes.
- **tolerations**: allow Pods to schedule onto tainted nodes.
- **affinity**: advanced rules (node or Pod affinity/anti‚Äëaffinity).

        # path from existing volume mount
        path:
      # Do not validate Policer CA. Do not do this in production
      # insecure: true
```

To enable guardrails you can set `minibridge.guardrails` list as:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-sequential-thinking oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version 1.0.0 --set 'minibridge.guardrails={secrets-redaction}'
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  guardrails:
  - covert-instruction-detection
  - sensitive-pattern-detection
  - shadowing-pattern-detection
  - schema-misuse-prevention
  - cross-origin-tool-access
  - secrets-redaction
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-sequential-thinking oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

To enable basic auth:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-sequential-thinking oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version 1.0.0 --set minibridge.basicAuth.value="supersecret"
```

or from a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
minibridge:
  basicAuth:
    value: "supersecret"
```

Then upgrade with:

```console
helm upgrade mcp-server-sequential-thinking oci://docker.io/acuvity/mcp-server-sequential-thinking --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml
```

Then you can connect through `http/sse` as usual given that you pass an `Authorization` header with your secret as Bearer token.

> [!CAUTION]
> While basic auth will protect against unauthorized access, you should use it only in controlled environment,
> rotate credentials frequently and **always** use TLS.

# üß† Server features

## üß∞ Tools (1)
<details>
<summary>sequentialthinking</summary>

**Description**:

```
A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached
```

**Parameter**:

| Name | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| branchFromThought | integer | Branching point thought number | No
| branchId | string | Branch identifier | No
| isRevision | boolean | Whether this revises previous thinking | No
