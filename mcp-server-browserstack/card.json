Tool names are clear and purposeful, descriptions adequately explain functionality and usage context (typically 1-2 sentences), and parameter documentation is generally comprehensive with clear purposes and constraints. However, some tools have overly brief descriptions that could benefit from more context about limitations or specific use cases, and a few parameter descriptions could be more detailed about expected formats or behavior.","score":"B"},
