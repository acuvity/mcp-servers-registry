Tool names are descriptive and intuitive (generate_area_chart, generate_bar_chart, etc.). Most descriptions effectively explain what each chart type does and provide usage context with examples. Parameter documentation is thorough with clear descriptions, types, constraints, and examples. However, some descriptions are overly verbose or contain awkward phrasing, and a few tools lack clarity about when to use them versus similar alternatives. The consistent structure and detailed examples elevate this above adequate, but the occasional verbosity and minor clarity issues prevent it from reaching excellent.","score":"B"},
